# Justic for VH-331b
List of people who agree that *Dreamerr Prime* is one of the worst planet names in the universe and want to do justice to <span class="whitespace-nowrap">VH-331b</span>â€”either by removing the extra "R" or bringing back its original name.

## How do I add my name on the list?

If you know how git works, you can open a pull request editing the `people.json` file and adding your name.
If you do not know how that works, you can either open an issue asking for help or write me at my discord `neeko.cat`.
